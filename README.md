# Inventory Cleaner

---
Ever had items you wanted to discard during pvp combat?
Dirt? Sand? Stone? Here's your solution!

***Disclaimers (2):***
- Since this mod works by sending inventory packets, servers may ban you for using it. Please check your server's rules before using this!
- No keybinding will be added for this, you have to manually click the blue or red buttons (so this doesn't turn into a macro)

This mod requires [**ImproperUI**](https://modrinth.com/mod/improperui) to run.
