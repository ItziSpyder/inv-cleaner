<h2 align="center" style="margin: auto;">📖 About</h2>

Ever had items you wanted to discard build up in your inventory over time?
Dirt? Sand? Stone? Here's your solution!

***Disclaimers (2):***
- Since this mod works by sending inventory packets, servers may ban you for using it. Please check your server's rules before using this!
- No keybinding will be added for this, you have to manually click the blue or red buttons (so this doesn't turn into a macro)

This mod requires [**ImproperUI**](https://modrinth.com/mod/improperui) to run.
